Before Recording:
1) Drop the current 440_database on MYSQL Workbench (if any), by running the create_db.py file by itself
2) Create only ONE new user account, where username = 'comp440' and password = 'pass1234'. Since ids 2 through 11 will be taken already when we clicked the "Initialize DB" button
3) Initialize database first
4) Might need do the note on views.py, line 175 to be sure it doesn't cause issues during recording
